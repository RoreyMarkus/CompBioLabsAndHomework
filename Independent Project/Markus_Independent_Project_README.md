Keystone Species Prairie Dogs: Gardeners or Rummagers?
Do prairie dog burrows have a positive impact on the health of their prairie ecosystem in the way they “garden” around their burrows?

Context (introduction)

Prairie dogs are an often underappreciated keystone species of the prairie environments in North America. While farmers typically hate them because of the damage burrows can do to livestock, they are vital to the prairie ecosystem. Their burrows provide homes to all sorts of animals, from invertebrates and insects to amphibians and owls. They are also a food source for predatory species like birds of prey, foxes, coyotes, and ferrets. But I am interested in the impact prairie dogs have on the plant life around their burrows. Plant thinning and diversity are important markers for the health of the prairie environment. Prairie dogs have a tendency to “garden” around their burrows, clearing out plants and limiting their growth. 

Methods

The data I am using was collected by students for an EBIO lab over two years. Data was collected on both a large scale and on a small scale. In the large scale data, students collected information on the ground coverage, in terms of how much ground was bare, how much had grass, how much had yucca, how much had cacti, and how much had other vegetation. This data individualized based on students’ class, location as marked by a flag, the site area, and whether or not it was within the colony. Students visited either the North or South site, and took measurements of the ground coverage as marked by flags on and around the colony. This data allows us to see the difference proximity to the colony has on plant life. 
In the small scale data, students collected information on the ground coverage, in terms of how much ground was bare, how much had grass, how much had yucca, how much had cacti, and how much had other vegetation. But the small scale data was individualized based on site and distance from prairie dog burrows selected by the students. Students visited either the North or South site, and took measurements of the ground coverage at specific distances from prairie dog burrows of their choosing. This data allows a bit more variety and individuality as opposed to the large scale data, which was at preselected sites. 
One issue I had with this data collection was how plants that were not grass, yucca, or cacti were just grouped together as “other plants.” I would like to have learned more about what they were, even if they were invasive like mullein, which I had personally noted at both sites. 



What the original authors did with the data:

Originally, students used this data in lab to analyze the effects of prairie dogs on plant abundance. It was meant to introduce the students to R, and how to use it for statistical analysis. Even though it was well collected data, it was not used in a necessarily serious way. It was just used to show students how to make boxplots and bar graphs, and how to select out certain parts of the data. 
What YOU did with the data and how you did it:
I decided to revisit this data. It was well collected and could be applied to more serious applications. I wanted to use it to understand the impact prairie dogs have on their local plant life, and use the diversity and abundance of the plants as a measure of local ecosystem health. Generally, plant diversity is an indicator of a healthy prairie ecosystem. But if the plant abundance is too high, it can put a strain on the limited resources of the prairie, like soil nutrients and water. If too many plants are present, it can cause them to dry out from a lack of water, making the area more susceptible to fires.

Results and conclusions

I found that off colony prairie has a higher diversity, 0.5421104, than on colony prairie, 0.4996311. But off colony prairie also has a higher plant abundance, 26.4, when compared to on colony prairie, 19. A higher diversity generally signifies a healthier ecosystem, but in this case, I would argue that the abundance is the more important factor. The difference between the diversities is relatively tiny when compared to the difference between the abundance. In prairie ecosystems, a high abundance can be detrimental to the overall health of the ecosystem. 

I also found a correlation in distance from the burrow and plant diversity. The data showed that the closer to the burrow, the higher the diversity. I also found that the closer to the burrow, the lower the vegetation coverage. However, this made me question whether the trends were true, or if the data was skewed, as there were more data points closer to the burrow. I would like to revisit this, and collect more data from further away. The trend of the diversity being higher the closer to the burrow was fascinating to me. It seems like the prairie dogs do “garden” with intention, reducing abundance but leaving diversity. Based on these criteria, I would argue that the prairie dog is not only a keystone species for animals in the prairie, but for the plants as well. Keeping a high diversity and a mid abundance is an important part of keeping the prairie ecosystem healthy.
