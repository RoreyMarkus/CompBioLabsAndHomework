# Lab 08 
## Purpose of this script
This script has a function I wrote that allows the user to insert different numbers in for the variables of the Discrete-Time Logistic Growth Equation
The function plots the output, with Time on the x-axis and Abundance on the y-axis. 

The variables involved in the function are:

     r = rate of growth  
     K = carrying capacity  
     Time(timeend) = total number of generations 
     Abundance(n) = initial abundance

## Information specific to "Markus_lab8" file.
In this specific case, the variables represented:

    r = 0.6 
    K = 5000
    timeend = 14 
    n = 2500
When this was plugged into growfunc, it was exported into the repository as Generation_Abundances.csv
growfunc also created a plot of the data.
